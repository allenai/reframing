        "Conduction is a form of heat transfer that takes place when it comes into contact with matter , the atoms and molecules move and they in turn collide with other atoms or molecules so the heat is transferred, making them move too. Conduction is the mode of heat transfer occurs from one part of a substance to another part of within the substance itself or with another substance which is placed in physical contact. Conduction is the movement of heat through a substance by the collision of molecules where the heat flows from the warmer to the cooler object until they are both at the same temperature. Molecules collide with other molecules and a heat transfer by conduction occurs. Molecules colliding with other molecules causes heat transfer by conduction. The way to make heat transfer by conduction occur is by colliding molecules together. This heat transfer happens by a phrase called conduction where molecules collide with other molecules. When molecules collide with other molecules a heat transfer by conduction occurs. When molecules collide with other molecules, heat transfer by conduction occurs."
